# NotesApp

A simple Android App for taking notes, built in Kotlin, and contains options to select your font from a limited range of options which user wants.
Built using LiveData( for handling data changes in real time), and Room( for handling database operations),
it is simple, yet powerful app for jotting down little things on the go. 

Here are some screenshots of its working:
